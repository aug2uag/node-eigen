# Node-Eigen

Node-Eigen provides native bindings to the [Eigen C++ library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for linear algebra. The goal is to follow Eigen's API as closely as possible. This project is currently a work in progress, and pull requests are welcome.

Supported platforms: **Mac OS X** | **Windows** | **Linux**
